# Problem Statement

Streaming services are many people’s primary method of listening to music. Unfortunately none of these services contain all of the music that a user might want to listen to. Additionally, the ability to share playlists across services is not a feature that exists yet. 

Suppose you use both Spotify and SoundCloud. You want to create a playlist of songs X, Y, and Z. X and Y are on Spotify and Z is on SoundCloud. Currently there is no single place to listen to all of these songs in a single playlist.
