# Qualities

1. Correctness

  Correctness is our most important quality because our app does not have that many features so the features we do have must work exactly as intended.

2. Reliability

  Reliability is second because playlists that people create need to persist over time.

3. Security

  Security is third because playlist that are created should only be able to be edited by people that have that access to them. Otherwise they should be readable only. 

4. User Efficiency

  User Efficiency is fourth because a user should be able to easily add a song to a playlist with as little hassle as possible. 

5. Portability

  Portability is our last quality because our app will most likely be used in a mobile context so we need to ensure that it is responsive for a variety of screen sizes.
